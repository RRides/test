##Introducing #disruptHOOLI
###This is not a plan for another transportation network.
###This is a plan to disrupt Uber as the dominant transportation network and install a cooperative in its place.

**The Plan**
**1. Form a chaufeurred ride cooperative**
**2. Publish plan**
**3. Crowdfund seed money**
**4. Build a transportation network**
**5. Recruit for chaufeur cooperatives.**
**6. Alpha test with virtual passengers and real drivers.**
**7. Beta test as another transportation network.**
**8. Drivers, in their role as equal owners, log out of competing networks en mass, generating surge events and the resulting Tweetstorms.**
**9. Declare responsibility and offer a complimentary membership, flat fares, and a dividend to new passengers.**
**10. Repeat until Drivers earn a living wage logged into the cooperative transportation network exclusively.**
**11. Tweet "all your ride are belong to us" to @uber @traviskachnik

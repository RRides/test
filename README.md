**This is how to #disruptUBER**

1. Form a ridesharing cooperative 

2. Build a transportation network

3. Recruit drivers

4. Test with virtual passengers and real drivers

5. Beta test with supporting passengers.

6. On the day Uber goes public, Drivers log out of all other transportation networks and exclusively provides rides on the cooperative network.

##This is how to #disruptUBER

**1. Form a ridesharing cooperative**

**2. Build a transportation network**

**3. Recruit drivers**

**4. Test with virtual passengers and real drivers**

**5. Beta test with supporting passengers.**

**6. On the day Uber goes public, Drivers log out of all other transportation networks and exclusively provides rides on the cooperative network.**
